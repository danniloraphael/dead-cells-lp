            <h2>What is Dead Cells?</h2>
            <p>Dead Cells is a rogue-lite, Castlevania-inspired action-platformer, allowing you to explore
            a sprawling, ever-changing castle… assuming you’re able to fight your way past its keepers.</p>
            <p>To beat the game, you’ll have to master 2D "souls-lite combat" with the ever-present
            threat of permadeath looming. No checkpoints. Kill, die, learn, repeat.</p>
            <div class="intro-grid">
                <div>
                    <p><b>RogueVania:</b> Intense 2D action with the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath in
                    a castle full of cuddly creatures.</p>
                    <p><b>Souls-lite combat:</b> Pattern-based bosses and minions, weapons and spells with unique gameplay.
                    Roll roll roll your boat gently down the stream...</p>

                    <p><b>Exploration:</b> Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. A fine place
                    for a holiday.</p>

                    <h3>Lore</h3>
                    <p>The Beheaded is unaware of how it came to be, but evidently It was created in the undying
                    shores as It refers to an empty vat “uncomfortably familiar”, and a skull on a desk “oddly familiar”.
                    Additionally, the Beheaded is known by the Prisoners and a few others. The Crypt Demon calls the
                    Beheaded an anomaly, and mentions that "she" was looking for it. It's currently unknown
                    who the 'she' is (although it is revealed in the queen and the sea dlc). The Beheaded hunts
                    down the King, hoping that killing him will bring some kind of change.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Despite being unable to speak, the Beheaded has quite the personality. The Beheaded
                    likes to make sarcastic remarks and jokes about the situations it finds itself in.
                    It also has quite the mean streak, tending to kick bodies around (such as that of the
                    Tutorial Knight), as well as pestering people. However, this does not mean it is completely
                    empty of remorse and empathy. The Beheaded seems upset by the sight of the cruel orders
                    from the King grims at the sight of a guard killed by the effects of the Malaise, 
                    is seen telling a dead prisoner to "rest in peace",[4] and lacking any kind of humor
                    when finding a hanged woman. Its emotions are symbolized by the color of its textbox.</p>
